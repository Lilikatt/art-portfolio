    "The game was widely recognised for its messaging about nature preservation, alongside its launch campaign of '1 download = 1 tree'. Through our partnership with Ecology we planted over 1 million mangrove trees in Madagascar.",
    "I was the art lead of a team of 8 artists, creating a rich environment with more than 60 animals for the player to discover. I also worked on the subsequent updates."
